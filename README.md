# Learn rust with me :)

#### This is the place where I will be posting all my rust code that I have been using to learn the rust programming language

- Everyone can use these structured notes/code to learn rust

- You should use these notes in parallel with the rust-lang's book

- These notes were written by me while I was learning rust from the book

- You should write your own code side-by-side, not just copy-paste 😒

- If you find any mistakes, the issues page is always there ❤️

- I will be adding more topics as I learn

## Installation

First, install rust from the [official rust website](https://rustup.rs/). Then,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamhrigved/learn-rust.git ~/learn-rust
cd ~/learn-rust/basic-concepts/hello_world
cargo run
```

#### Start leaning! 😉
