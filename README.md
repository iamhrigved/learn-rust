# Learn rust with me :)

#### This is the place where I will be posting all my rust code that I have been using to learn the rust programming language

- Everyone can use these structured notes/code to learn rust

- You should use these notes in parallel with the book

- These notes were written by me while I learned rust from the rust-lang's book

- You should write your own code side-by-side, not just copy-paste 😒

- If you find any mistakes, the issue page is always there ❤️

- I will be adding more topics as I learn

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/iamhrigved/learn-rust.git ~/learn-rust
cd ~/learn-rust
```

#### Start leaning! 😉
