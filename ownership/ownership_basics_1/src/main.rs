    // the `String` datatype is used when we do not know how much space a variable is going to take
    // at compile time
    // so, this datatype stores data on the heap which makes it able to store an amount of text,
    // which is not known at compile time
    // string literals such as `let s = "Hello World!"` are immutable but `String` is mutable

      //just after the closing curly brace, a function `drop` is called automatically
      // by rust which gives back the memory to the allocator

    // here, both s1 and s2 are pointing to the same data on the heap
    // the thing which is being copied here is nothing but the `String` data that is, the pointer
    // to the actual data on the heap
    // if we instead copied the actual data, this process would be very expensive

    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    println!("s3: {s3}, s4: {s4}"); // both, s3 and s4 are valid

    // because these values are stored in the stack making the process inexpensive
    let str1 = "Hello";
